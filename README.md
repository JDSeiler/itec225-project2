This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
First, install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`.

Second, run `npm start` or `yarn start`. This command will start
a local development server on localhost:3000 as well as the LAN
address of your machine (192.168.0.xxx). 

If the application is
accessed via the LAN address, the notification features of the app
will not work. This is due to restrictions on the Notification API
on non-localhost domains that are not using HTTPS.
